# Task-Management-System-Using-PHP-and-SQL
This project is about task management where users can view and keep track of tasks assigned to them and admin can create tasks and edit or delete them.
Here we used php in the backend for storing the data in a database.Frontend code by html and css.
The first page is index page where user can login as an old user or as an admin,if a new user they can first register then login.
Next is the user dashboard page and admin dashboard page.
There are various buttons on the left side panel. For users it includes viewing the tasks, projects, applying leave and viewing the leave applications status. They can also update the status of tasks if completed or in progress which will update it in the database also.
For admins it includes creating tasks and projects,edit or delete a project or task, approve or reject the leave applications.
Last button is logout that destroys a session and brings back the user to the index page.
